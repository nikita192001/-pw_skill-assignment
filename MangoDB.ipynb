      "source": "MongoDB is a document-oriented database classified as NoSQL. It’s become popular throughout the industry in recent years and integrates extremely well with Python. Unlike traditional SQL RDBMSs, MongoDB uses collections of documents instead of tables of rows to organize and store data.MongoDB stores data in schemaless and flexible JSON-like documents. \nA non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems. Instead, non-relational databases use a storage model that is optimized for the specific requirements of the type of data being stored.\nYou need high performance, particularly read performance: The way distributed NoSQL systems like Cassandra and Riak work means you can usually get very high read performance by adding more boxes. Some go so far as to automatically replicate data across nodes to ensure you always have plenty of copies of your data to access.\n\nYou need high availability (HA): Data replicates across nodes in a NoSQL system, so the failure of a single node does not necessarily result in data loss or downtime for your application. This also means you can easily add or remove nodes from clusters without impacting availability",

      "source": "Features of MongoDB –\n\nSchema-less Database: It is the great feature provided by the MongoDB. A Schema-less database means one collection can hold different types of documents in it. Or in other words, in the MongoDB database, a single collection can hold multiple documents and these documents may consist of the different numbers of fields, content, and size. It is not necessary that the one document is similar to another document like in the relational databases. Due to this cool feature, MongoDB provides great flexibility to databases.\nDocument Oriented: In MongoDB, all the data stored in the documents instead of tables like in RDBMS. In these documents, the data is stored in fields(key-value pair) instead of rows and columns which make the data much more flexible in comparison to RDBMS. And each document contains its unique object id.\nIndexing: In MongoDB database, every field in the documents is indexed with primary and secondary indices this makes easier and takes less time to get or search data from the pool of the data. If the data is not indexed, then database search each document with the specified query which takes lots of time and not so efficient.\nScalability: MongoDB provides horizontal scalability with the help of sharding. Sharding means to distribute data on multiple servers, here a large amount of data is partitioned into data chunks using the shard key, and these data chunks are evenly distributed across shards that reside across many physical servers. It will also add new machines to a running database.\nReplication: MongoDB provides high availability and redundancy with the help of replication, it creates multiple copies of the data and sends these copies to a different server so that if one server fails, then the data is retrieved from another server.\nAggregation: It allows to perform operations on the grouped data and get a single result or computed result. It is similar to the SQL GROUPBY clause. It provides three different aggregations i.e, aggregation pipeline, map-reduce function, and single-purpose aggregation methods\nHigh Performance: The performance of MongoDB is very high and data persistence as compared to another database due to its features like scalability, indexing, replication, etc.",
