Programmers can run multiple subtasks of an application at the same time by using multithreading. It lets threads talk to the same processor and share resources like files, data, and memory. In addition, it makes it easier for the user to continue running a program even when a portion of it is blocked or too long.\n\nTo use multithreading, we need to import the threading module in Python Program.",

Responsiveness\nMultithreading in an interactive application enables a program to continue running even if a section is blocked or executing a lengthy process, increasing user responsiveness.\n3. Economy\nAllocating memory and resources for process creation is an expensive procedure because it is a time and space-consuming task.\n4. Scalability\nThe advantages of multi-programming become much more apparent in the case of multiprocessor architecture, when threads may execute in parallel on many processors. When there is just one thread, it is impossible to break the processes into smaller jobs performed by different processors.\n\n###### Disadvantages of Multithreading\nIt needs more careful synchronization.\nIt can consume a large space of stocks of blocked threads.\nIt needs support for thread or process.\nIf a parent process has several threads for proper process functioning, the child processes should also be multithreaded because they may be required.\nIt imposes context switching overhead.\n",
