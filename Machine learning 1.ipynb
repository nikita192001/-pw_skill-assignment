Testing set is usually a properly organized dataset having all kinds of data for scenarios that the model would probably be facing when used in the real world. Often the validation and testing set combined is used as a testing set which is not considered a good practice. If the accuracy of the model on training data is greater than that on testing data then the model is said to have overfitting. This data is approximately 20-25% of the total data available for the project.  "
